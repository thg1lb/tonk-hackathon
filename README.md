# Build your own little internet with Tonk

Tonk is the copilot-friendly toolchain that gives independent developers freedom to build powerful shared software.

You can use the Tonk toolchain to:

- Build applications within a copilot-friendly framework
- Manage complex state interoperable across people and apps
- Publish and share your apps

## Get Started

Start building apps and integrations with [our documentation](https://tonk-labs.github.io/tonk/introduction.html).

## Project Status

- **Local-First Architecture**: Built on Automerge for conflict-free data synchronization.
- **Quick Start**: Create new projects instantly with `tonk create`.
- **Offline Support**: IndexedDB-based storage auto syncs when connectivity resumes.
- **Privacy Focused**: Keeps user data local by default.
- **React + TypeScript**: Modern development stack with full type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling out of the box.
- **Package and Share**: Easily deploy and share your Tonk apps (work in progress).

As an early stage project we are very open to feedback and keen to help builders - so please reach out to the team and we will endeavour to support your usecase.

## Hackathon ideas

Learning Tonk requires a mindset shift because as developers we're used to thinking in terms of singular applications that are tightly coupled to databases.

Tonk doesn't just help you build apps or store data. Tonk can be best described as helping you build **your own little internet: a way to store shared highly mutable state across many apps and many users, and build ephemeral services, apps and tools on top of that shared state.**

![illustrative-example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f15dd6b-8d49-4ea1-a328-3b43d7abecd4)


Each app can read and write to the shared state with barely any development overhead - no need to worry about migrations, caching, auth or permissions.

Here are some examples of what Tonk can help with:

### üó∫Ô∏è Maps

An evolving dataset for your friends to add locations, routes, reviews, planned trips - and surface whatever you like in custom maps apps.

*Hackathon idea:* A social mapping app where friends can collaboratively pin spots, share routes, and plan trips‚Äîwith the option to remix the shared dataset into custom experiences like foodie maps, hiking guides, or road trip planners.

### üéØ Productivity

A fluctuating set of todos for your colleagues to track progress on ephemeral projects without forcing everyone to use the same productivity app.

*Hackathon idea:* A multiplayer to-do list for temporary teams - where shared project tasks live in a public space and AI nudges contributors to focus on what matters before the project dissolves.

### üí∞ Banking

Aggregated financial information for your household to track your finances and make intelligent investments.

*Hackathon idea:* A household finance dashboard that syncs every member‚Äôs bank accounts, applies AI to optimize spending, and auto-generates investment proposals based on shared goals.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Health

A dataset for your family to make health data available to bespoke meditation, exercise or sleep apps.

*Hackathon idea:* A health data layer for families ‚Äî syncing sleep, steps, and stress scores across devices and enabling personalized wellness bots that work across meditation, exercise, and diet apps.

### üí¨ Social

An ad-free, private chatboard for your friends, but where everyone customises their experience with pluggable components such as games, calendars and notifications.

*Hackathon idea:* A modular group chat app where every conversation is a programmable space - friends can add shared games, calendars, polls, or moodboards, and the feed adapts to how your group vibes, not how the algorithm dictates.

### ü§ñ Assistants

An AI that can assist you with full context from your chat apps, calendars, todo boards and social feeds.

*Hackathon idea:* A privacy-first AI assistant that reads your calendar, chat threads, and todos from your shared spaces ‚Äî then recommends actions, summarizes life, and shares updates with your friends.
